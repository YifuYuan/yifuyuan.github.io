I’m currently a master’s student at Carnegie Mellon University, pursuing the [M.S. in Robotics Systems Development (MRSD)](https://mrsd.ri.cmu.edu/) under the [Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/). I obtained my bachelor’s degree, double majoring in Robotics Engineering and Computer Science at [Worcester Polytechnic Institute](https://www.wpi.edu/), where I worked closely with [Prof. Ali Yousefi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ali-yousefi-244a8043/) and at the [Autonomous Loco-Manipulation Systems (ALMaA) Group](https://almaswpi.github.io/) led by [Prof. Mahdi Agheli](https://www.wpi.edu/people/faculty/mmaghelih).


My recent research focuses on a comprehensive control framework to achieve perceptive locomotion and manipulation for the quadruped robot.
My ultimate goal is to propel the advancement of general-purpose humanoid robots, increasing its adaptability to dynamic settings to assist humans.
